# PythonGarbage
Random garbage I've written in Python.

**Wordle (requires wordlist.txt)** - simple command-line based game of Wordle. Works as you'd expect.

**Circle** - draws a circle, filled or unfilled, of the radius given, in ascii. Probably the most useful tool to exist.

**FizzBuzz** - the classic interview question, using Modulo.
